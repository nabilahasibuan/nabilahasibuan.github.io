						<h3>Leading & Motivating change in Sport</h3>
					</header>
					
					<p>
						A technology business called Hawk-Eye Innovations is dedicated to developing optical tracking
						and officiating technology that will make sports more fair, secure, interesting, and informed.
						It has been dubbed "the most advanced officiating gadget utilized in sport" and is precise
						in tracking goals to the milimeter. The "TRACK" systems' primary components are optical tracket 
						and camera calibration technology utilized for object, ball, and performance tracking. The ball 
						tracking solutions, which concentrate on ball movement and rotation, are a key component of the 
						optical tracking capabilities.

						<h3>What problem does this solve?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						In Tennis, recreational players have a long-standing unwritten rule on line calling. According 
						to the rule, player B must be assured of their call if player A makes a shot that is very close
						to being in or out. Player B must concede the point if they are openly unsure about how to rule
						on the shot or have any doubts ar all. So, in conclusion, the Hawk-Eye System solves the problem, 
						that players don't have to rule the shot and have any doubts. This makes the game more fair.

						<h3>How does the Hawk-Eye System operate?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						The systems tracks the ball from various angles using six (sometimes seven) high-performance
						cameras that are typically mounted on the underside of the stadium roof. A three-dimensional
						model of the ball's trajectory is then produced using a triangulation and combination of the 
						video from the six cameras. Although Hawk-Eye is not perfect, it is widely regarded as an 
						unbiased second opinion in sports and is claimed to be accurate to within 3.6 milimeters. 
						Governing bodies for tennis, cricket, and association football have approved it as a method of
						adjuction with varying numbers of cameras based on the sport.

						<h3>Who uses this technology?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>	
						Paul Hawkins created Hawk-Eye, which is today owned by Sony. Hawk-Eye is working 23 of the top
						25 sports leagues and federations globally. Almost all major sports, including cricket, football, 
						rugby, lawn tennis, badminton, snooker, and others, utilise this technology. The major slam 
						competitions implemented the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking and challenge system in 2006 as a result of
						many extremely controversials line calls made against Serena Williams, the current women's number
						1, during the 2004 US Open. The device costs about $60,000 per court.

						<h3>Expectations of the comapany</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						Umpires utilize the Hawk-Eye to determine whether a ball is in or out. Because players can challenge
						close-range decisions, the umpire must seek a second view from Hawk-Eye. This makes it easier for 
						spectators to determine if a shot was successful or unsuccessful, especially when the ball is just on 
						the line. The Hawk-Eye has brought a level of strategy to the game of tennis and others sports that
						never before existed.
